# Automation

Welcome to the "automation" repository! This is where I store code that automates tasks to save time and effort. From connecting to social media platforms like LinkedIn to interacting with job boards like Indeed, these scripts aim to make life easier by handling repetitive or manual tasks. Each automation is intended to serve a specific purpose, and Iâ€™ll be continually adding new scripts to improve and expand the capabilities of this repository. If you have ideas or requests for new automations, feel free to contribute or open an issue!

## Projects

#### Discord & NYTimes API:
- Automation: I developed a Discord bot for my community channel, Space Creators, that integrates with the New York Times API. This bot automatically fetches and shares the latest 5 tech news articles, keeping my audience engaged and up to date with current events in the tech world. This automation helps foster real-time interaction and provides value to the community without manual effort.
